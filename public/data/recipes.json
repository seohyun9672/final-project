Remove lid and continue to cook, \n stirring frequently, \n \n until soft apples fall apart and juices thicken to a thin-syrup consistency, \n \n about 5 minutes longer. Pour onto a large-lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and cool to room temperature. (Can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days.)\nAdjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a rectangle, \n \n about 10 by 16 inches. Transfer to a large cookie sheet. (I suggest lining the sheet with parchment paper; this ensures the crostada doesn't stick and allows easy cleanup.)\nSpread cooked apples over pastry, \n leaving a 2-inch border. Fold up pastry borders over apples. Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping. Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. sugar. Bake until pastry is golden brown, \n \n 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature with optional ice cream or whipped cream.",

Add 2 1/2 cups of the white sugar. Stir once every day for the final 10 days. The cherries will give the juice back its pinkish color.\nDay Thirty: Drain fruit and reserve it and the liquid.

Cake must be started within 3 days after receiving the starter, \n or you should freeze the starter to use at a later date.

Stir, \n \n then add 1/2 of the drained reserved fruit from the starter. Stir, \n \n then add 1 cup of the golden raisins, \n \n 1 cup of the chopped nuts and 1 cup of the coconut. Stir until all ingredients are combined. The batter will be stiff. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan. Repeat for cake number two.\nBake cakes at in the preheated oven for 55 to 65 minutes.",

Cook the jam at a rolling boil for 2 minutes, \n stirring constantly. Remove from heat and skim off any foam.\nSterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the cherry jam into the hot, \n \n sterilized jars, \n \n filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, \n and screw on rings.\nPlace a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, \n \n then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, \n cover the pot, \n and process for 15 minutes, \n or the time as recommended by your county Extension agent.\nRemove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, \n \n several inches apart, \n \n until cool. Once cool, \n \n press the top of each lid with a finger, \n \n ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, \n \n dark area.",

Slice each quarter into 3 slices, \n from core end to bottom, \n and place in a large bowl. Cut remaining pear in half; peel, \n and core one half and add to the bowl. Peel, \n core, \n and slice the other half as directed above and add to the bowl.

Keep adding pear slices, \n filling in any gaps, \n until they are all in the skillet.\nReduce heat to medium-low. Cook, \n undisturbed, \n until pears are fork-tender and color develops to the liquid, \n about 20 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on a rack in the lower third of the oven.\nRemove skillet from heat and place unbaked pie shell on top of the fruit, \n using a fork to tuck the edges of the pie shell toward the bottom of the skillet. Place skillet on the prepared baking sheet in the preheated oven. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake until crust is brown, \n 28 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven. Place a heat-safe plate, \n larger than the skillet, \n upside down over the crust.\nUse oven mitts to grab the plate and skillet together and quickly flip the skillet contents onto the plate; this move is tricky and requires some forearm strength and dexterity. After the flip, \n if the contents are not centered on the plate, \n use a spatula to gently move to the center. Add any fruit that remained in the skillet, \n and drizzle any remaining liquid over the top of the tarte tatin.\nAllow to sit 15-20 minutes, \n then serve warm.",

    "directions": "In a large bowl, \n mix together the flour, \n sugar and salt. Using a box grater, \n grate the cold butter atop the flour mixture. Working quickly and using your hands, \n break the butter bits into the flour until they're evenly distributed and resemble the size of small peas.\nAdd 4 tablespoons of water and mix. The mixture will be shaggy at this point. From here, \n add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until the dough comes together (generally about 3 additional tablespoons). Flour a work surface and dump the dough onto it. Knead a few times until it comes together. Form dough into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour, \n ideally overnight.\nJust before the dough is ready to remove from the fridge, \n mix together the filling. In a medium bowl, \n toss together the pear slices, \n brown sugar, \n cocoa powder, \n coffee grounds, \n vanilla extract and salt.\nRemove the disk of dough from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature for 10 minutes. Liberally flour a work surface and rolling pin. Begin to roll the dough to a 16-inch round, \n being sure to rotate it every so often to avoid sticking, \n Using the bottom of a bowl or plate that measures about 6 inches in diameter, \n cut out 3 circles. Re-roll the scraps to get 1 additional circle.\nArrange the pears slices neatly in a circular pattern in the center of each of the pie crust rounds, \n leaving about 1 1/2 inch clear at the edges. Fold over the edges to cover about 1/2 inch of the filling. Repeat with the remaining rounds. Transfer the galettes to a baking sheet lined with Reynolds® Parchment Paper and place in the freezer to chill for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, \n preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.\nLastly, \n brush the pie crust edges with the egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Transfer to the oven to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, \n until the edges are golden brown. Check on the galettes periodically. If at any time the crusts' edges are getting too brown, \n take a piece of Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil and tent over the edges. When the edges are golden brown, \n remove from the oven. Serve warm with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of your favorite vanilla ice cream.",

    "directions": "Cut sweet potato in half lengthwise. Cut each in half again lengthwise, \n then in half cross-wise. Cut each piece in half to make about 16 evenly sized chunks. Transfer into pot; cover with water and add salt. Bring to a simmer on high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and cook until potatoes are tender, \n about 17 minutes. Drain thoroughly; return to pot and mash potatoes. You will need 1 1/2 cups mashed sweet potatoes. Cool thoroughly.\nTransfer cooled mashed potatoes to a mixing bowl. Add brown sugar and buttermilk. Mix together until well combined.\nPlace self-rising flour in a separate mixing bowl. Grate frozen butter into flour, \n tossing with a fork to coat with flour after each addition of about 1/3 to 1/2 stick. This will prevent butter from clumping. Mixture should look like floury pieces of butter. Add sweet potato mixture. Toss with a fork until evenly distributed, \n but don't overmix.\nTransfer mixture onto a lightly floured work surface. Push and press mixture together into a rectangular shape, \n about 1 1/2 inches thick. Dough will be floury and a bit crumbly. Fold rectangle into thirds, \n lifting up one-third and folding onto the middle and doing the same with the other side. Dust with a bit of flour if sticking.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with a silicone mat.\nPress dough into a rectangle again, \n about 1 inch thick. Repeat the tri-fold step. Press out into a rectangle, \n about 1 inch thick. Trim off the rough edges to square off the sides; this will maximize rising. Cut into 8 equal portions. Transfer to prepared baking pan, \n spacing biscuits evenly. Brush tops lightly with 1 tablespoon melted butter.\nBake in preheated oven until browned, \n 20 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.\nMix 4 tablespoons butter (room temperature), \n pomegranate syrup, \n and pomegranate juice together in a small bowl. Spread on warm biscuits. Sprinkle with a few pomegranate seeds for garnish.",
